- In a maximum time of 2 years the functionality of evrywhr.me will be part of all APIs used by AR/VR systems, that are seemingly springing all around us. 


- Until then, evrywhr.me should seek to fill in the gap of our connected-ness in a seamless way, i.e. it should work with minimal User interactioN (UN). 
  
      -- The more enriched the user's mobility i.e. the multitude of real-time data providing sensors, the more absence of UN can be achieved. 
      
      -- The videofeed will always have only button, an X on the corner to cancel out of an evrywhr.me session. 
      
      -- This defines the philosophy of evrywhr.me as UN reduces User iMmersion (UM). 
      
    
  Evrywhr.me will either work in your device or it wont, there will never be any configuration required. 
  
  In essence, UN -> 0 (UN should tend to zero) to maximize UM.
